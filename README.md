### Compatition for our logo change
After many years of using the faithful logo for UWHNZ on our communications and internal branding it is time
for it to retire along with the wooden hockey sticks. We want to let some new blood in and take its place as the face of
Underwater Hockey New Zealand.

Before the logo is banished we need to find a new one and UWHNZ is looking to its members to design a new logo.

So put your creative caps on create that iconic logo that shows what Underwater Hockey in New Zealand is all about and
win your self some Underwater Hockey gear, plus free entry for a team at a UWHNZ tournament.
